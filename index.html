        <div class="subheading mb-5">Theatre, Film, and Digital Productionüìù</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born on February 28th, 2002 in Hayward. I was mostly raised in Pleasanton, California, which is in the Bay Area. And thanks to my early travels around the world with my parents, much of my childhood was filled with adventure and exploration. By the age of fifteen, I had visited China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Tahiti, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. During my travels, I had the opportunity to watch multiple international films, where I learned what international unity means. As I entered high school, I started to develop my own views about film and entertainment as a whole.<br><br>

          People try to escape the hardships of the world by watching films. Someone has fun watching a movie and then moves on with their day, dealing with reality once again. Despite my old views, as I grew older and watched more movies and shows, I began to realize the true purpose of motion pictures, which started changing the way I saw film and the world. I find that the definition of entertainment has changed. To entertain also means to possibly allow yourself or someone to think about an idea, a hope, a feeling, and so on. Films are not just made to give their audience joy for twenty-five minutes to two hours but also to have them think about the realities of the movies‚Äô themes and messages. People watch to escape the world but also to be closer to themselves as people and reality. I watched more movies after every family trip. I wanted to see and always learned something from them in the end. Later on, I decided to expand my creativity and understanding of film by watching Japanese, Chinese, and Korean animations. After exploring many aspects of entertainment, my interest in filmmaking grew. This is when I reached the conclusion that I wanted to study motion pictures in college.<br><br>

          In hopes to impact audiences with personal and world messages, I pursued first-hand opportunities where I can learn more about filmmaking. Aside from taking classes about screenwriting, film techniques, and other related topics, I found myself indebted to R‚ÄôShorts, the only film club on campus. Here, I experienced positions that Hollywood professionals would take up for real productions. I once was a production assistant for the Fall 2021 adaptation, where I learned and explored a wide range of crew positions. For example, I was professionally involved with the set design crew. During my time with this department, I learned about prop placement and why each aspect of a set is important to the characters and story. In the Winter 2021 adaptation, I held the 2nd Assistant director role. As a part of the Head Crew, I handled lots of pre-production documents and the overall crew on set during shooting times. From this experience, I developed an understanding that all the arduous paperwork had importance in the communication between crew heads and post-production staff. At the moment, I am now in the continuity crew for the Spring 2022 adaptation and a stage manager for a theatrical play for the organization, Golden Mean Players.
